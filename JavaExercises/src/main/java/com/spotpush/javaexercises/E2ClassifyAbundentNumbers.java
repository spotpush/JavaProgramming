/**
Write a Java program to classify Abundant number (integers) 
between 1 to 10,000.
In number theory, an abundant number is a number for which the sum of its 
proper divisors is greater than the number itself.
Example :
The first few abundant numbers are:
12, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 66, 70, 72, 78, 80, 84, 
88, 90, 96, 100, 102,â€¦
The integer 12 is the first abundant number. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 
3, 4 and 6 for a total of 16.
